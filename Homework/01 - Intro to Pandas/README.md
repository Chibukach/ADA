# 02 - Intro to Pandas

In this lab session we have explored the fundamental features of [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), and then we practiced the basics of Data Wrangling
with some real-world datasets (credits to [fonnesbeck](https://github.com/fonnesbeck)).

In this homework you will test your skills in using the Pandas library for a few basic Data Transformation and Data Wrangling tasks.
The homework consists in filling the cells indicated as exercises in the *two* notebooks presented during the
[Lab 02 - Intro to Pandas](https://github.com/ADAEPFL/Labs/tree/master/02%20-%20Intro%20to%20Pandas).

For each exercise, please provide *both* a written explanation of the steps you will apply to manipulate the data, and the 
corresponding code. Keep in mind that writing the explanation at the beginning can help you in two ways: 1) clarifying the steps in your
mind before writing the actual code, 2) earning you points if the description is correct, regardless of the potential issues in your code.
