But [the Romney campaign] will try to\\npaint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism.\"\\nHe said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a\\nhelpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter\\'s failed\\nattempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in t980. \"They are so excited about it,\" he said. \"Over\\nand over again they talked about bow it would be just like Jimmy Carter\\'s failed raid. They feel it is\\ngoing to give them .a last-minute landslide in the election.\"\\nThe source, however, said lie was dubious about the tactic. \"To me, it is indicative that they have lost\\ntouch with a huge portion of the electorate,\" he said.\\nThe source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present. But he said, \"These\\nwere the top guys in the party. It was a .private, unguarded planning conversation.\" He further\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739615\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the\\noperation.\\nHowever, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,\\nSeptember 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama\\'s reaction to what happened in Libya\\n\"inexplicable\" and added that Obama is \"more intent on campaigning than meeting his\\nresponsibilities as commander-in-chief.\" He went on to warn that Obama\\'s policies in Libya\\nendangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. \"I am astonished,\" Rove said. \"We are projecting weakness\\nwhen we need to be projecting strength.\"\\nSimilarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who\\nbecame known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. \"This\\nis a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the\\nmost transparent in history,\" he told Fox News. \"And it\\'s the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of\\ncover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four\\nAmericans.\"\\nGiuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it\\nseemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. \"I think it\\'s because they have this\\nnarrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,\" he said. \"They never say the words \\'Islamic fundamentalist\\nterrorism\\'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia \\u2014 he was going to declare\\nthis a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very\\nconvenient narrative.\"\\nLikewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration\\'s response to\\n\"the terrorist attack\" in Libya as And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and\\nvice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. \"I think they want to do their very best to\\nkeep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect\\ntransparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,\" Romney said.\\nAdded Ryan, \"Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are\\nsaying that this is a terrorist attack? We\\'ll leave it up to you to decide whether it\\'s a cover-up or not.\"\\nIn an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were\\ndivided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One\\nunnamed Romney adviser described them as \"a huge gift\" to the campaign. \"Across the board \\u2014\\ndomestic, economic and foreign-policy issues \\u2014 President Obama has been outmatched by events,\" he\\nsaid. \"He\\'s an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he\\'s been outmatched.\"\\nBut other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as\\nthe central issue. \"They\\'ll tell you that you\\'ve got to focus people on the fact that their economic\\nprospects are not very good and all that,\" the aide told Politico. \"Well, Romney\\'s been trying to do that\\nnow since he clinched the nomination at the end of April \\u2014 and he\\'s failed. The president is better at\\ndeflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on\\nindividual voters.\"\\nCraig Unger is the New York Times bestselling author of \"House of Bush, House of Saud,\" and a\\nfrequent analyst on CNN, ABC Radio, Air America, The Charlie Rose Show, NBC\\'s Today Show and\\nother broadcast outlets.
